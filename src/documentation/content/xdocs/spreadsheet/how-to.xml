    <section><title>How to use the HSSF API</title>

        <section><title>Capabilities</title>
            <p>This release of the how-to outlines functionality for the 
            current svn trunk.
            Those looking for information on previous releases should
            look in the documentation distributed with that release.</p>
            <p>
              HSSF allows numeric, string, date or formuala cell values to be written to
              or read from an XLS file. Also
              in this release is row and column sizing, cell styling (bold,
              italics, borders,etc), and support for both built-in and user 
	      defined data formats.  Also available is
              an event-based API for reading XLS files.
              It differs greatly from the read/write API
              and is intended for intermediate developers who need a smaller
              memory footprint. 
              </p>
        </section>
        <section><title>Different APIs</title>
           <p>There are a few different ways to access the HSSF API. These
              have different characteristics, so you should read up on
              all to select the best for you.</p>

                <section><title>Writing a new file</title>

                    <p>The high level API (package: org.apache.poi.ss.usermodel)
                    is what most people should use. Usage is very simple.
                    </p>
                    <p>Workbooks are created by creating an instance of
                    org.apache.poi.ss.usermodel.Workbook. Either create
                    a concrete class directly 
                    (org.apache.poi.hssf.usermodel.HSSFWorkbook or
                     org.apache.poi.xssf.usermodel.XSSFWorkbook), or use
                    the handy factory class
                    org.apache.poi.ss.usermodel.WorkbookFactory.
                    </p>
                    <p>Sheets are created by calling createSheet() from an existing
                    instance of Workbook, the created sheet is automatically added in
                    sequence to the workbook. Sheets do not in themselves have a sheet
                    name (the tab at the bottom); you set
                    the name associated with a sheet by calling
                    Workbook.setSheetName(sheetindex,&quot;SheetName&quot;,encoding).
                    For HSSF, the name may be in 8bit format 
                    (HSSFWorkbook.ENCODING_COMPRESSED_UNICODE)
                    or Unicode (HSSFWorkbook.ENCODING_UTF_16). Default 
                    encoding for HSSF is 8bit per char. For XSSF, the name
                    is automatically handled as unicode.
                    </p>
                    <p>Rows are created by calling createRow(rowNumber) from an existing
                    instance of Sheet. Only rows that have cell values should be
                    added to the sheet. To set the row's height, you just call
                    setRowHeight(height) on the row object. The height must be given in
                    twips, or 1/20th of a point. If you prefer, there is also a
                    setRowHeightInPoints method.
                    </p>
                    <p>Cells are created by calling createCell(column, type) from an
                    existing Row. Only cells that have values should be added to the
                    row. Cells should have their cell type set to either
                    Cell.CELL_TYPE_NUMERIC or Cell.CELL_TYPE_STRING depending on
                    whether they contain a numeric or textual value. Cells must also have
                    a value set. Set the value by calling setCellValue with either a
                    String or double as a parameter. Individual cells do not have a
                    width; you must call setColumnWidth(colindex, width) (use units of
                    1/256th of a character) on the Sheet object. (You can't do it on
                    an individual basis in the GUI either).</p>
                    <p>Cells are styled with CellStyle objects which in turn contain
                    a reference to an Font object. These are created via the
                    Workbook object by calling createCellStyle() and createFont().
                    Once you create the object you must set its parameters (colors,
                    borders, etc). To set a font for an CellStyle call
                    setFont(fontobj).
                    </p>
                    <p>Once you have generated your workbook, you can write it out by
                    calling write(outputStream) from your instance of Workbook, passing
                    it an OutputStream (for instance, a FileOutputStream or
                    ServletOutputStream). You must close the OutputStream yourself. HSSF
                    does not close it for you.
                    </p>
                    <p>Here is some example code (excerpted and adapted from
                    org.apache.poi.hssf.dev.HSSF test class):</p>

        <section><title>Reading or modifying an existing file</title>

<p>Reading in a file is equally simple. To read in a file, create a
new instance of org.apache.poi.poifs.Filesystem, passing in an open InputStream, such as a FileInputStream
for your XLS, to the constructor. Construct a new instance of
org.apache.poi.hssf.usermodel.HSSFWorkbook passing the
Filesystem instance to the constructor. From there you have access to
all of the high level model objects through their assessor methods
(workbook.getSheet(sheetNum), sheet.getRow(rownum), etc).
</p>
<p>Modifying the file you have read in is simple. You retrieve the
object via an assessor method, remove it via a parent object's remove
method (sheet.removeRow(hssfrow)) and create objects just as you
would if creating a new xls. When you are done modifying cells just
call workbook.write(outputstream) just as you did above.</p>
<p>An example of this can be seen in
<link href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/poi/trunk/src/examples/src/org/apache/poi/hssf/usermodel/examples/HSSFReadWrite.java">org.apache.poi.hssf.usermodel.examples.HSSFReadWrite</link>.</p>
         </section>
        </section>

        <anchor id="event_api" />
        <section><title>Event API (HSSF Only)</title>

          <p>The event API is newer than the User API.  It is intended for intermediate
             developers who are willing to learn a little bit of the low level API
             structures.  Its relatively simple to use, but requires a basic
             understanding of the parts of an Excel file (or willingness to
             learn).  The advantage provided is that you can read an XLS with a
             relatively small memory footprint.
          </p>
          <p>One important thing to note with the basic Event API is that it
             triggers events only for things actually stored within the file.
             With the XLS file format, it is quite common for things that
             have yet to be edited to simply not exist in the file. This means
             there may well be apparent "gaps" in the record stream, which
             you either need to work around, or use the
             <link href="#record_aware_event_api">Record Aware</link> extension
             to the Event API.</p>
          <p>To use this API you construct an instance of
			 org.apache.poi.hssf.eventmodel.HSSFRequest. Register a class you
 			 create that supports the
 			 org.apache.poi.hssf.eventmodel.HSSFListener interface using the
 			 HSSFRequest.addListener(yourlistener, recordsid).  The recordsid
			 should be a static reference number (such as BOFRecord.sid) contained
			 in the classes in org.apache.poi.hssf.record.  The trick is you
			 have to know what these records are.  Alternatively you can call
			 HSSFRequest.addListenerForAllRecords(mylistener).  In order to learn
			 about these records you can either read all of the javadoc in the
			 org.apache.poi.hssf.record package or you can just hack up a
			 copy of org.apache.poi.hssf.dev.EFHSSF and adapt it to your
			 needs.  TODO: better documentation on records.</p>
                    <p>Once you've registered your listeners in the HSSFRequest object
                    you can construct an instance of
                    org.apache.poi.poifs.filesystem.FileSystem (see POIFS howto) and
                    pass it your XLS file inputstream.  You can either pass this, along
                    with the request you constructed, to an instance of HSSFEventFactory
                    via the HSSFEventFactory.processWorkbookEvents(request, Filesystem)
                    method, or you can get an instance of DocumentInputStream from
                    Filesystem.createDocumentInputStream(&quot;Workbook&quot;) and pass
                    it to HSSFEventFactory.processEvents(request, inputStream).  Once you
                    make this call, the listeners that you constructed receive calls to
                    their processRecord(Record) methods with each Record they are
                    registered to listen for until the file has been completely read.
                    </p>
                    <p>A code excerpt from org.apache.poi.hssf.dev.EFHSSF (which is
                    in CVS or the source distribution) is reprinted below with excessive

     <section><title>Record Aware Event API (HSSF Only)</title>
<p>
This is an extension to the normal 
<link href="#event_api">Event API</link>. With this, your listener
will be called with extra, dummy records. These dummy records should
alert you to records which aren't present in the file (eg cells that have
yet to be edited), and allow you to handle these.
</p>
<p>
There are three dummy records that your HSSFListener will be called with:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>org.apache.poi.hssf.eventusermodel.dummyrecord.MissingRowDummyRecord
   <br />
   This is called during the row record phase (which typically occurs before
   the cell records), and indicates that the row record for the given
   row is not present in the file.</li>
 <li>org.apache.poi.hssf.eventusermodel.dummyrecord.MissingCellDummyRecord
   <br />
   This is called during the cell record phase. It is called when a cell
   record is encountered which leaves a gap between it an the previous one.
   You can get multiple of these, before the real cell record.</li>
 <li>org.apache.poi.hssf.eventusermodel.dummyrecord.LastCellOfRowDummyRecord
   <br />
   This is called after the last cell of a given row. It indicates that there
   are no more cells for the row, and also tells you how many cells you have
   had. For a row with no cells, this will be the only record you get.</li>
</ul>
<p>
To use the Record Aware Event API, you should create an
org.apache.poi.hssf.eventusermodel.MissingRecordAwareHSSFListener, and pass
it your HSSFListener. Then, register the MissingRecordAwareHSSFListener
to the event model, and start that as normal.
</p>
<p>
One example use for this API is to write a CSV outputter, which always
outputs a minimum number of columns, even where the file doesn't contain
some of the rows or cells. It can be found at 
<code>/src/examples/src/org/apache/poi/hssf/eventusermodel/examples/XLS2CSVmra.java</code>,
and may be called on the command line, or from within your own code.
The latest version is always available from
<link href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/poi/trunk/src/examples/src/org/apache/poi/hssf/eventusermodel/examples/">subversion</link>.
</p>
<p>
<em>In POI versions before 3.0.3, this code lived in the scratchpad section. 
 If you're using one of these older versions of POI, you will either
 need to include the scratchpad jar on your classpath, or build from a</em>
 <link href="../subversion.html">subversion checkout</link>.

     <section><title>XSSF and SAX (Event API)</title>

	 <p>If memory footprint is an issue, then for XSSF, you can get at
      the underlying XML data, and process it yourself. This is intended 
      for intermediate developers who are willing to learn a little bit of 
      low level structure of .xlsx files, and who are happy processing
      XML in java. Its relatively simple to use, but requires a basic
      understanding of the file structure. The advantage provided is that 
      you can read a XLSX file with a relatively small memory footprint.
     </p>
     <p>One important thing to note with the basic Event API is that it
       triggers events only for things actually stored within the file.
       With the XLSX file format, it is quite common for things that
       have yet to be edited to simply not exist in the file. This means
       there may well be apparent "gaps" in the record stream, which
       you need to work around.</p>
     <p>To use this API you construct an instance of
       org.apache.poi.xssf.eventmodel.XSSFReader. This will optionally
       provide a nice interace on the shared strings table, and the styles.
       It provides methods to get the raw xml data from the rest of the
       file, which you will then pass to SAX.</p>
     <p>This example shows how to get at a single known sheet, or at
       all sheets in the file. It is based on the example in svn
       src/examples/src/org/apache/poi/xssf/eventusermodel/exmaples/FromHowTo.java</p>

     <section><title>Low Level APIs</title>

<p>The low level API is not much to look at. It consists of lots of
&quot;Records&quot; in the org.apache.poi.hssf.record.* package,
and set of helper classes in org.apache.poi.hssf.model.*. The
record classes are consistent with the low level binary structures
inside a BIFF8 file (which is embedded in a POIFS file system). You
probably need the book: &quot;Microsoft Excel 97 Developer's Kit&quot;
from Microsoft Press in order to understand how these fit together
(out of print but easily obtainable from Amazon's used books). In
order to gain a good understanding of how to use the low level APIs
should view the source in org.apache.poi.hssf.usermodel.* and
the classes in org.apache.poi.hssf.model.*. You should read the
documentation for the POIFS libraries as well.</p>

                <section><title>Generating XLS from XML</title>
<p>If you wish to generate an XLS file from some XML, it is possible to
write your own XML processing code, then use the User API to write out 
the document.</p>
<p>The other option is to use <link href="http://cocoon.apache.org/">Cocoon</link>.
In Cocoon, there is the <link href="http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/userdocs/xls-serializer.html">HSSF Serializer</link>,
which takes in XML (in the gnumeric format), and outputs an XLS file for you.</p>
     </section>
                <section><title>HSSF Class/Test Application</title>

<p>The HSSF application is nothing more than a test for the high
level API (and indirectly the low level support). The main body of
its code is repeated above. To run it:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>download the poi-alpha build and untar it (tar xvzf
    tarball.tar.gz)
    </li>
    <li>set up your classpath as follows:
    <code>export HSSFDIR={wherever you put HSSF's jar files}
export LOG4JDIR={wherever you put LOG4J's jar files}
export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$HSSFDIR/hssf.jar:$HSSFDIR/poi-poifs.jar:$HSSFDIR/poi-util.jar:$LOG4JDIR/jog4j.jar</code>
    </li><li>type:
    <code>java org.apache.poi.hssf.dev.HSSF ~/myxls.xls write</code></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>This should generate a test sheet in your home directory called <code>&quot;myxls.xls&quot;</code>.  </p>
<ul>
    <li>Type:
    <code>java org.apache.poi.hssf.dev.HSSF ~/input.xls output.xls</code>
    <br/>
    <br/>
This is the read/write/modify test.  It reads in the spreadsheet, modifies a cell, and writes it back out.
Failing this test is not necessarily a bad thing.  If HSSF tries to modify a non-existant sheet then this will
most likely fail.  No big deal.  </li>
</ul>
     </section>
    <section><title>Logging facility</title>
        <p>POI can dynamically select its logging implementation. POI tries to
        create a logger using the System property named "org.apache.poi.util.POILogger".
        Out of the box this can be set to one of three values:
        </p>
        <ul>
           <li>org.apache.poi.util.CommonsLogger</li>
           <li>org.apache.poi.util.NullLogger</li>
           <li>org.apache.poi.util.SystemOutLogger</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        If the property is not defined or points to an invalid classthen the NullLogger is used.
        </p>
        <p>
        Refer to the commons logging package level javadoc for more information concerning how to
        <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging/api/index.html">configure commons logging.</link>

    <section><title>HSSF Developer's Tools</title>

<p>HSSF has a number of tools useful for developers to debug/develop
stuff using HSSF (and more generally XLS files). We've already
discussed the app for testing HSSF read/write/modify capabilities;
now we'll talk a bit about BiffViewer. Early on in the development of
HSSF, it was decided that knowing what was in a record, what was
wrong with it, etc. was virtually impossible with the available
tools. So we developed BiffViewer. You can find it at
org.apache.poi.hssf.dev.BiffViewer. It performs two basic
functions and a derivative.
</p>
<p>The first is &quot;biffview&quot;. To do this you run it (assumes
you have everything setup in your classpath and that you know what
you're doing enough to be thinking about this) with an xls file as a
parameter. It will give you a listing of all understood records with
their data and a list of not-yet-understood records with no data
(because it doesn't know how to interpret them). This listing is
useful for several things. First, you can look at the values and SEE
what is wrong in quasi-English. Second, you can send the output to a
file and compare it.
</p>
<p>The second function is &quot;big freakin dump&quot;, just pass a
file and a second argument matching &quot;bfd&quot; exactly. This
will just make a big hexdump of the file.
</p>
<p>Lastly, there is &quot;mixed&quot; mode which does the same as
regular biffview, only it includes hex dumps of certain records
intertwined. To use that just pass a file with a second argument
matching &quot;on&quot; exactly.</p>
<p>In the next release cycle we'll also have something called a
FormulaViewer. The class is already there, but its not very useful
yet. When it does something, we'll document it.</p>

     </section>
                <section><title>What's Next?</title>

<p>Further effort on HSSF is going to focus on the following major areas: </p>
<ul>
<li>Performance:  POI currently uses a lot of memory for large sheets.</li>
<li>Charts: This is a hard problem, with very little documentation.</li>
</ul>
