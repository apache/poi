/**
 * Used to help optimise cell evaluation result caching by allowing applications to specify which
 * parts of a workbook are <em>final</em>.<br>
 * The term <b>final</b> is introduced here to denote immutability or 'having constant definition'.
 * This classification refers to potential actions (on the evaluated workbook) by the evaluating
 * application.  It does not refer to operations performed by the evaluator ({@link
 * WorkbookEvaluator}).<br>
 * <br>
 * <b>General guidelines</b>:
 * <ul>
 * <li>a plain value cell can be marked as 'final' if it will not be changed after the first call
 * to {@link WorkbookEvaluator#evaluate(EvaluationCell)}.
 * </li>
 * <li>a formula cell can be marked as 'final' if its formula will not be changed after the first
 * call to {@link WorkbookEvaluator#evaluate(EvaluationCell)}.  This remains true even if changes
 * in dependent values may cause the evaluated value to change.</li>
 * <li>plain value cells should be marked as 'not final' if their plain value value may change.
 * </li>
 * <li>formula cells should be marked as 'not final' if their formula definition may change.</li>
 * <li>cells which may switch between plain value and formula should also be marked as 'not final'.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <b>Notes</b>:
 * <ul>
 * <li>If none of the spreadsheet cells is expected to have its definition changed after evaluation
 * begins, every cell can be marked as 'final'. This is the most efficient / least resource
 * intensive option.</li>
 * <li>To retain freedom to change any cell definition at any time, an application may classify all
 * cells as 'not final'.  This freedom comes at the expense of greater memory consumption.</li>
 * <li>For the purpose of these classifications, setting the cached formula result of a cell (for
 * example in {@link org.apache.poi.ss.usermodel.FormulaEvaluator#evaluateFormulaCell(org.apache.poi.ss.usermodel.Cell)})
 * does not constitute changing the definition of the cell.</li>
 * <li>Updating cells which have been classified as 'final' will cause the evaluator to behave
 * unpredictably (typically ignoring the update).</li>
 * </ul>
