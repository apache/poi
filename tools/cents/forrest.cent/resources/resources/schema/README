  Document Type Definitions
  -------------------------
  
  
In this folder you find the catalog of the XML entities and DTD that will 
be used by Forrest.

They include schemas for:

 1) documentation
 2) specifications
 3) FAQs
 4) changes
 5) TODO lists
 
and the markup has been kept as similar as possible to XHTML (along with the 
same entities).

This has been used instead of DocBook to simplify the learning effort but still
remove all the unstructured elements of XHTML.
