       <p>
          A number of people are using POI for a variety of purposes.  As with
          any new API or technology, the first question people generally ask
          is not "how can I" but rather "Who else is doing what I'm about to 
          do?"  This is understandable with the abismal success rate in the 
          software business.  These case statements are meant to help create
          confidence and understanding.

            <title>Submitting a Case Study</title>
            <p>
                We are actively seeking case studies for this page (after all it
                just started).  Andrew C. Oliver (acoliver at apache dot org) has
                agreed to have a few T-Shirts printed with the POI logo (once its
                chosen) for the first
                few best submissions.  To submit a case study, either
                <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/poi/getinvolved/index.html">
                    submit a patch for this page</link> or email it to the
                <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/mail2.html#poi">mailing list
                </link> (with [PATCH] prefixed subject, please).

               <p>
           <link href="http://www.sunshinesys.com/">Sunshine Systems</link> deveveloped a
            POI based reporting solution for a price optimization software package which
            is used by major retail chains.
         </p>
         <p>The solution allowed the retailer's merchandise planners and managers to request a
           markdown decision support reports and price change reports using a standard browser
           The users could specify report type, report options, as well as company,
division,
           and department filter criteria. Report generation took place in the
multi-threaded
           application server and was capable of supporting many simultaneous report requests.
         </p>
         <p>The reporting application collected business information from the price
optimization
           application's Oracle database. The data was aggregated and summarized
 based upon the
           specific report type and filter criteria requested by the user. The
final report was
           rendered as a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet using the POI HSSF API and
 was stored on
           the report database server for that specific user as a BLOB. Reports
 could be
           seamlessly and easily viewed using the same browser.
         </p>
         <p>The retailers liked the solution because they had instantaneous access
 to critical
           business data through an extremely easy to use browser interface. They
 did not need
           to train the broader user community on all the complexities of the optimization
           application. Furthermore, the reports were generated in an Excel spreadsheet
format,
           which everyone was familiar with and which also allowed further data
 analysis using
           standard Excel features.

                    The
                    <link href="http://www.lbank.lt/">Bank of Lithuania</link>
                    reports financial statistical data to Excel format using the
                    <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/poi/">Jakarta POI</link>
                    project's

                        HSSF</link> API.  The system is based on Oracle JServer and
                    utilizes a Java stored procedure that outputs to XLS format
                    using the HSSF API.  - Arian Lashkov (alaskov at lbank.lt)

                <title>Bit Tracker by Tracker Inc., and ThinkVirtual</title>
                <p>
                    Bit Tracker (http://www.bittracker.com/) is the world's first and only web-based drill bit tracking system to manage your company's critical bit information and use that data to its full potential. It manages all bit related data, including their usage, locations, how they were used, and results such as rate of penetration and dull grade after use.  This data needs to be available in Excel format for backwards compatibility and other uses in the industry.  After using CSV and HTML formats, we needed something better for creating the spreadsheets and POI is the answer.  It works great and was easy to implement.  Kudos to the POI team.

                <p>
                    Edwards and Kelcey Technology (http://www.ekcorp.com/) developed a
                    Facility
                    Managament and Maintenance System for the Telecommunications industry
                    based
                    on Turbine and Velocity. Originally the invoicing was done with a simple
                    CVS
                    sheet which was then marked up by accounts and customized for each client.
                    As growth has been consistent with the application, the requirement for
                    invoices that need not be touched by hand increased. POI provided the
                    solution to this issue, integrating easily and transparently into the
                    system. POI HSSF was used to create the invoices directly from the server
                    in
                    Excel 97 format and now services over 150 unique invoices per month.

                <p>
                    <link href="http://www.clickfind.com/">ClickFind Inc.</link> used the POI
                    projects HSSF API to provide their medical
                    research clients with an Excel export from their electronic data
                    collection web service Data Collector 3.0.  The POI team's assistance
                    allowed ClickFind to give their clients a data format that requires less
                    technical expertise than the XML format used by the Data Collector
                    application.  This was important to ClickFind as many of their current
                    and potential clients are already using Excel in their day-to-day
                    operations and in established procedures for handling their generated
                    clinical data.  - Jared Walker (jared.walker at clickfind.com)

                        files, EDI, CSV files, etc.
                    </p>

                    <p>It is obvious that Microsoft Excel files are also supported.
                        POI has been used to successfully implement this support in ETL4ALL.</p>
