   Specific support for DocumentSummaryInformation, SummaryInformation types.
   <p>Support classes for "well-known" section format IDs and property IDs. The
    streams <tt>\005DocumentSummaryInformation</tt> and
    <tt>\005SummaryInformation</tt> (or any streams with the same section
    format IDs as the aforementioned) are considered well-known. So are most
    property IDs in these streams.</p>
