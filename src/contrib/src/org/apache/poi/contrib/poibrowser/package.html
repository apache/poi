   <p>The <strong>POI Browser</strong> is a very simple Swing GUI tool that
    displays the internal structure of a Microsoft Office file. It concentrates
    on streams in the <em>Horrible Property Set Format (HPSF)</em>. In order to
    access these streams the POI Browser uses the package
    <tt>org.apache.poi.hpsf</tt>.</p>

   <p>A file in  Microsoft's Office format can be seen as a filesystem within a
    file. For example, a Word document like <var>sample.doc</var> is just a
    simple file from the operation system's point of view. However, internally
    it is organized into various directories and files. For example,
    <var>sample.doc</var> might consist of the three internal files (or
    "streams", as Microsoft calls them) <tt>\001CompObj</tt>,
    <tt>\005SummaryInformation</tt>, and <tt>WordDocument</tt>. (In these names
    \001 and \005 denote the unprintable characters with the character codes 1
    and 5, respectively.) A more complicated Word file typically contains a
    directory named <tt>ObjectPool</tt> with more directories and files nested
    within it.</p>

   <p>The POI Browser makes these internal structures visible. It takes one or
    more Microsoft files as input on the command line and shows directories and
    files in a tree-like structure. On the top-level POI Browser displays the
    (operating system) filenames. An internal file (i.e. a "stream" or a
    "document") is shown with its name, its size and a hexadecimal dump of its
    first bytes.</p>

   <p>The POI Browser pays special attention to property set streams. For
    example, the <tt>\005SummaryInformation</tt> stream  contains information
    like title and author of the document. The POI Browser opens every stream
    in a POI filesystem. If it encounters a property set stream, it displays
    not just its first bytes but analyses the whole stream and displays its
    contents in a more or less readable manner.</p>
