      <p>
        It is essential that you verify the integrity of the downloaded files using the PGP or MD5 signatures. 
        Please read <link href="http://httpd.apache.org/dev/verification.html">Verifying Apache HTTP Server Releases</link>
	for more information on why you should verify our releases. This page provides detailed instructions which you can use for POI artifacts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PGP signatures can be verified using PGP or GPG. First download the KEYS file as well as the .asc signature files 
        for the relevant release packages. Make sure you get these files from the main distribution directory, 
        rather than from a mirror. Then verify the signatures using
