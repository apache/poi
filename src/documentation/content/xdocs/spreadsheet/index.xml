            <title>Overview</title>

            <p>HSSF is the POI Project's pure Java implementation of the 
            Excel '97(-2007) file format. XSSF is the POI Project's pure 
            Java implementation of the Excel 2007 OOXML (.xlsx) file 
            format.</p>
            <p>HSSF and XSSF provides ways to read spreadsheets create, 
            modify, read and write XLS spreadsheets. They provide:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>low level structures for those with special needs</li>
                <li>an eventmodel api for efficient read-only access</li>
                <li>a full usermodel api for creating, reading and modifying XLS files</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For people converting from pure HSSF usermodel, who wish
              to use the joint SS Usermodel for HSSF and XSSF support, then
              see the <link href="converting.html">ss usermodel converting
              guide</link>.
            </p>
            <p>
        An alternate way of generating a spreadsheet is via the <link href="http://cocoon.apache.org">Cocoon</link> serializer (yet you'll still be using HSSF indirectly). 
         With Cocoon you can serialize any XML datasource (which might be a ESQL page outputting in SQL for instance) by simply 
        applying the stylesheet and designating the serializer.
            </p>
            <p>
        If you're merely reading spreadsheet data, then use the 
        eventmodel api in either the org.apache.poi.hssf.eventusermodel 
        package, or the org.apache.poi.xssf.eventusermodel package, depending
        on your file format.
            </p>
            <p>
        If you're modifying spreadsheet data then use the usermodel api.  You
        can also generate spreadsheets this way.
            </p>
            <p>
        Note that the usermodel system has a higher memory footprint than
        the low level eventusermodel, but have the major advantage of being 
        much simpler to work with. Also please be aware that as the new
        XSSF supported Excel 2007 OOXML (.xlsx) files are XML based, 
        the memory footprint for processing them is higher than for the 
        older HSSF supported (.xls) binary files.
