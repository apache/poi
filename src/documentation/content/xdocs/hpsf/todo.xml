   <p>The following functionalities should be added to HPFS:</p>

   <ol>
    <li>
     Improve writing support! We need convenience classes and methods for
     easily writing summary information streams and document summary
     information streams.
    </li>
    <li>
     Add resource bundles to
     <code>org.apache.poi.hpsf.wellknown</code> to ease
     localizations. This would be useful for mapping standard property IDs to
     localized strings. Example: The property ID 4 could be mapped to "Author"
     in English or "Verfasser" in German.
    </li>
    <li>
     Implement reading functionality for those property types that are not
     yet supported. HPSF should return proper Java types instead of just byte
     arrays.
    </li>
    <li>
     Add WMF to <code>java.awt.Image</code> example code in the <link
      href="thumbnails.html">Thumbnail HOW-TO</link>.
    </li>
   </ol>
