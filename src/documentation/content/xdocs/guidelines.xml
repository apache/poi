  <section><title>The Licensing</title>
   <p>
     The POI project is <link href="http://www.opensource.org">OpenSource</link>
     and developed/distributed under the <link 
     href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/licence-FAQ.html">
     Apache Software License</link>.  Unlike other licenses this license allows
     free open source development; however, it does not require you to release
     your source or use any particular license for your source.  If you wish
     to contribute to POI (which you're very welcome and encouraged to do so)
     then you must agree to release the rights of your source to us under this
     license.

  <section><title>Publicly Available Information on the file formats</title>
  <p>
   In early 2008, Microsoft made a fairly complete set of documentation
   on the binary file formats freely and publicly available. These were 
   released under the <link href="http://www.microsoft.com/interop/osp">Open
   Specification Promise</link>, which does allow us to use them for
   building open source software under the <link 
     href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/licence-FAQ.html">
   Apache Software License</link>.
  </p>
  <p>
   You can download the documentation on Excel, Word, PowerPoint and
   Escher (drawing) from 
   <link href="http://www.microsoft.com/interop/docs/OfficeBinaryFormats.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/interop/docs/OfficeBinaryFormats.mspx</link>.
   Documentation on a few of the supporting technologies used in these
   file formats can be downloaded from
   <link href="http://www.microsoft.com/interop/docs/supportingtechnologies.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/interop/docs/supportingtechnologies.mspx</link>.
  </p>
  <p>
   Previously, Microsoft published a book on the Excel 97 file format.
   It can still be of plenty of use, and is handy dead tree form. Pick up
   a copy of "Excel 97 Developer's Kit" from your favourite second hand
   book store.
  </p>
  <p>
   The newer Office Open XML (ooxml) file formats are documented as part
   of the ECMA / ISO standardisation effort for the formats. This 
   documentation is quite large, but you can normally find the bit you
   need without too much effort! This can be downloaded from
   <link href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-376.htm">http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-376.htm</link>,
   and is also under the <link href="http://www.microsoft.com/interop/osp">OSP</link>.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is also worth checking the documentation and code of the other
   open source implementations of the file formats.
  </p>
  </section>
  <section><title>I just signed an NDA to get a spec from Microsoft and I'd like to contribute</title>
   <p>
     In short, stay away, stay far far away.  Implementing these file formats
     in POI is done strictly by using public information. Most of this Public
     Information currently comes from the documentation that Microsoft
     makes freely available (see above). The rest of the public information
     includes sources from other open source projects, books that state the 
     purpose intended is for allowing implementation of the file format and 
     do not require any non-disclosure agreement and just hard work. 
     We are intent on keeping it legal, by contributing patches you agree to 
     do the same.
   </p>
   <p> 
     If you've ever received information regarding the OLE 2 Compound Document
     Format under any type of exclusionary agreement from Microsoft, or  
     received such information from a person bound by such an agreement, you 
     cannot participate in this project. Sorry. Well, unless you can persuade 
     Microsoft to release you from the terms of the NDA on the grounds that
     most of the information is now publically available. However, if you have
     been party to a Microsoft NDA, you will need to get clearance from Microsoft
     before contributing.
   </p>
   <p>
     Those submitting patches that show insight into the file format may be 
     asked to state explicitly that they have only ever read the publicly
     available file format information, and not any received under an NDA
     or similar, and have only made us of the public documentation.

  <section><title>I just want to get involved but don't know where to start</title>
   <ul>
     <li>Read the rest of the website, understand what POI is and what it does,
         the project vision, etc.</li>
     <li>Use POI a bit, look for gaps in the documentation and examples.</li>
     <li>Join the <link href="mailinglists.html">mailing lists</link> and share your knowledge with others.</li>
     <li>Get <link href="subversion.html">Subversion</link> and check out the POI source tree</li>
     <li>Documentation is always the best place to start contributing, maybe you found that if the documentation just told you how to do X then it would make more sense, modify the documentation.</li>
     <li>Contribute examples - if there's something people are often asking about on the <link href="mailinglists.html">user list</link> which isn't covered in the documentation or current examples, try writing an example of this and uploading it as a patch.</li>
     <li>Get used to building POI, you'll be doing it a lot, be one with the build, know its targets, etc.</li>
     <li>Write Unit Tests.  Great way to understand POI.  Look for classes that aren't tested, or aren't tested on a public/protected method level, start there.</li>
     <li>Download the file format documentation from Microsoft -
      <link href="http://www.microsoft.com/interop/docs/OfficeBinaryFormats.mspx">OLE2 Binary File Formats</link> or
      <link href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-376.htm">OOXML XML File Formats</link></li>
     <li>Submit patches (see below) of your contributions, modifications.</li>
     <li>Check the <link href="http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?product=POI">bug database</link> for simple problem reports, and write a patch to fix the problem</li>
     <li>Review existing patches in the <link href="http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?product=POI">bug database</link>, and report if they still apply, if they need unit tests atc.</li>
     <li>Add in new features, see <link href="http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?product=POI">Bug database</link> for suggestions.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>The Nutch project also have a very useful guide on becoming a 
    new developer in their project. While it is written for their project,
    a large part of it will apply to POI too. You can read it at
    <link href="http://wiki.apache.org/nutch/Becoming_A_Nutch_Developer">http://wiki.apache.org/nutch/Becoming_A_Nutch_Developer</link>. The
    <link href="http://community.apache.org/">Apache Community Development
    Project</link> also provides guidance and mentoring for new contributors.</p>
  </section>
  <section><title>Submitting Patches</title>
   <p>
     Create patches by getting the latest sources from Subversion.
     Alter or add files as appropriate.  Then, from the poi directiory,
     type svn diff > mypatch.patch.  This will capture all of your changes
     in a patch file of the appropriate format. However, svn diff won't
     capture any new files you may have added. So, if you've added any 
     files, create an archive (tar.bz2 preferred as its the smallest) in a 
     path-preserving archive format, relative to your poi directory. 
     You'll attach both files in the next step.
   </p>
   <p>
     Ideally, patches should be submitted early and often. This is for
     two key reasons. Firstly, it's much easier to review smaller patches
     than large ones. This means that smaller patches are much more likely
     to be applied to SVN in a timely fashion. Secondly, by sending in your
     patches earlier rather than later, it's much easier to get feedback
     on your coding and direction. If you've missed an easier way to do something,
     or are duplicating some (probably hidden) existing code, or taking things
     in an unusual direction, it's best to get the feedback sooner rather than
     later! As such, when submitting patches to POI, as with other Apache
     Software Foundation projects, do please try to submit early and often, rather
     than "throwing a large patch over the wall" at the end.
   </p>
   <p> 
     Patches are submitted via the <link href="http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?product=POI">Bug Database</link>.  
     Create a new bug, set the subject to [PATCH] followed by a brief description.  Explain you patch and any special instructions and submit/save it.  
     Next, go back to the bug, and create attachements for the patch files you
     created.  Be sure to describe not only the files purpose, but its format. 
     (Is that ZIP or a tgz or a bz2 or what?).
   </p>
   <p>
     Make sure your patches include the @author tag on any files you've altered
     or created.  Make sure you've documented your changes and altered the 
     examples/etc to reflect them.  Any new additions should have unit tests.
     Lastly, ensure that you've provided approriate javadoc.  (see 
     <link href="http://poi.apache.org/resolutions/res001.html">Coding
     Standards</link>).  Patches that are of low quality may be rejected or 
     the contributer may be asked to bring them up to spec.
   </p>
   <p>If you use a unix shell, you may find the following following
    sequence of commands useful for building the files to attach.</p>
   <source>
# Run this in the root of the checkout, i.e. the directory holding
#  build.xml and poi.pom

# Build the directory to hold new files
mkdir /tmp/poi-patch/
mkdir /tmp/poi-patch/new-files/

# Get changes to existing files
svn diff > /tmp/poi-patch/diff.txt

# Capture any new files, as svn diff won't include them
# Preserve the path
svn status | grep "^\?" | awk '{printf "cp --parents %s /tmp/poi-patch/new-files/\n", $2 }' | sh -s

# tar up the new files
cd /tmp/poi-patch/new-files/
tar jcvf ../new-files.tar.bz2
cd ..

# Upload these to bugzilla
echo "Please upload to bugzilla:"
echo "   /tmp/poi-patch/diff.txt"
echo "   /tmp/poi-patch/new-files.tar.bz2"
   </source>

  <section><title>Mentoring and Committership</title>
   <p>The POI project will generally offer committership to contributors who send
    in consistently good patches over a period of several months.</p>
   <p>The requirement for "good patches" generally means patches which can be applied
    to SVN with little or no changes. These patches should include unit test, and
    appropriate documentation. Whilst your first patch to POI may require quite a 
    bit of work before it can be committed by an existing committer, with any luck
    your later patches will be applied with no / minor tweaks. Please do take note
    of any changes required by your earlier patches, to learn for later ones! If
    in doubt, ask on the <link href="mailinglists.html">dev mailing list</link>.</p>
   <p>The requirement for patches over several months is to ensure that committers
    remain with the project. It's very easy for a good developer to fire off half
    a dozen good patches in the couple of weeks that they're working on a POI
    powered project. However, if that developer then moves away, and stops 
    contributing to POI after that spurt, then they're not a good candidate for
    committership. As such, we generally require people to stay around for a while,
    submitting patches and helping on the mailing list before considering them
    for committership.</p>
   <p>Where possible, patches should be submitted early and often. For more details
    on this, please see the "Submitting Patches" section above.</p>

   <p>Where possible, the existing developers will try to help and mentor new
    contributors. However, everyone involved in POI is a volunteer, and it may
    happen that your first few patches come in at a time when all the committers
    are very busy. Do please have patience, and remember to use the 
    <link href="mailinglists.html">dev mailing list</link> so that other
    contributors can assist you!</p>
   <p>For more information on getting started at Apache, mentoring, and local
    Apache Committers near you who can offer advice, please see the
    <link href="http://community.apache.org/">Apache Community Development
    Project</link> website.</p>
