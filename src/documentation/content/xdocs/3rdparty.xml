 <section><title>Contributed Components</title>
  <p>
   These are not necessarily deemed to be high enough quality to be included in the
   core distribution, but they have been tested under <link href="contrib.xml">
   several key environments</link>, they are provided under the same license
   as Poi, and they are included in the POI distribution under the
   <code>contrib/</code> directory.
  </p>

  <p>
   <strong>None as yet!</strong> - although you can expect that some of the links
   listed below will eventually migrate to the "contributed components" level, and
   then maybe even into the main distribution.

 <section><title>Patch Queue</title>
  <p><link href="patches.html">Submissions of modifications</link>
   to POI which are awaiting review. Anyone can
   comment on them on the dev mailing list - code reviewers are needed!
   <strong>Use these at your own risk</strong> - although POI has no guarantee
   either, these patches have not been reviewed, let alone accepted.
  </p>
 </section>

 <section><title>Other Extensions</title>
  <p>The other extensions listed here are <strong>not endorsed</strong> by the POI
   project either - they are provided as a convenience only. They may or may not work,
   they may or may not be open source, etc.
