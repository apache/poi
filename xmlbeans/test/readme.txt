The doc folder under v2\tests has two docs

1)BuildingAndRunningTests.txt

The documentation here shows how to run & build tests.


2)TestOrganization.txt:

Documentation here shows the general layout of how the test framework is
structured and the best practise in while creating new tests. This documentation
should be read before adding new tests. It also shows when it becomes necessary
to make additions/modifications to testbuild.xml.
