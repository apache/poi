/**
 * Demonstrates how to add an image to a worksheet and set that image's size
 * to a specific number of milimetres irrespective of the width of the columns
 * or height of the rows. Overridden methods are provided so that the location
 * of the image - the cells row and column co-ordinates that define the top
 * left hand corners of the image - can be identified either in the familiar
 * Excel manner - A1 for instance - or using POI's methodolody of a column and
 * row index where 0, 0 would indicate cell A1.
 *
 * The best way to make use of these techniques is to delay adding the image to
 * the sheet until all other work has been completed. That way, the sizes of
 * all rows and columns will have been adjusted - assuming that step was
 * necessary. Even though the anchors type is set to prevent the image moving
 * or re-sizing, this setting does not have any effect until the sheet is being
 * viewed using the Excel application.
 *
 * The key to the process is the HSSFClientAnchor class. It accepts eight
 * parameters that define, in order;
 *
 *      * How far - in terms of co-ordinate position - the image should be inset
 *      from the left hand border of a cell.
 *      * How far - in terms of co-ordinate positions - the image should be inset
 *      from the from the top of the cell.
 *      * How far - in terms of co-ordinate positions - the right hand edge of
 *      the image should protrude into a cell (measured from the cell's left hand
 *      edge to the image's right hand edge).
 *      * How far - in terms of co-ordinate positions - the bottm edge of the
 *      image should protrude into a row (measured from the cell's top edge to
 *      the image's bottom edge).
 *      * The index of the column that contains the cell whose top left hand
 *      corner should be aligned with the top left hand corner of the image.
 *      * The index of the row that contains the cell whose top left hand corner
 *      should be aligned with the image's top left hand corner.
 *      * The index of the column that contains the cell whose top left hand
 *      corner should be aligned with the image's bottom right hand corner
 *      * The index number of the row that contains the cell whose top left
 *      hand corner should be aligned with the images bottom right hand corner.
 *
 * It can be used to add an image into cell A1, for example, in the following
 * manner;
 *
 *      HSSFClientAnchor anchor = new HSSFClientAnchor(0, 0, 0, 0,
 *          (short)0, 0, (short)1, 1);
 *
 * The final four parameters determine that the top left hand corner should be
 * aligned with the top left hand corner of cell A1 and it's bottom right
 * hand corner with the top left hand corner of cell B2. Think of the image as
 * being stretched so that it's top left hand corner is aligned with the top
 * left hand corner of cell A1 and it's bottom right hand corner is aligned with
 * the top left hand corner of cell B1. Interestingly, this would also produce
 * the same results;
 *
 *       anchor = new HSSFClientAnchor(0, 0, 1023, 255,
 *          (short)0, 0, (short)0, 0);
 *
 * Note that the final four parameters all contain the same value and seem to
 * indicate that the images top left hand corner is aligned with the top left
 * hand corner of cell A1 and that it's bottom right hand corner is also
 * aligned with the top left hand corner of cell A1. Yet, running this code
 * would see the image fully occupying cell A1. That is the result of the
 * values passed to parameters three and four; these I have referred to as
 * determing the images co-ordinates within the cell. They indicate that the
 * image should occupy - in order - the full width of the column and the full
 * height of the row.
 *
 * The co-ordinate values shown are the maxima; and they are independent of
 * row height/column width and of the font used. Passing 255 will always result
 * in the image occupying the full height of the row and passing 1023 will
 * always result in the image occupying the full width of the column. They help
 * in situations where an image is larger than a column/row and must overlap
 * into the next column/row. Using them does mean, however, that it is often
 * necessary to perform conversions between Excel's characters units, points,
 * pixels and millimetres in order to establish how many rows/columns an image
 * should occupy and just what the varous insets ought to be.
 *
 * Note that the first two parameters of the HSSFClientAchor classes constructor
 * are not made use of in the code that follows. It would be fairly trivial
 * however to extend these example further and provide methods that would centre
 * an image within a cell or allow the user to specify that a plain border a
 * fixed number of millimetres wide should wrap around the image. Those first
 * two parameters would make this sort of functionality perfectly possible.
 *
 * Owing to the various conversions used, the actual size of the image may vary
 * from that required; testing has so far found this to be in the region of
 * plus or minus two millimetres. Most likely by modifying the way the
 * calculations are performed - possibly using double(s) throughout and
 * rounding the values at the correct point - it is likely that these errors
 * could be reduced or removed.
 *
 * A note concerning Excels' image resizing behaviour. The HSSFClientAnchor
 * class contains a method called setAnchorType(int) which can be used to
 * determine how Excel will resize an image in reponse to the user increasing
 * or decreasing the dimensions of the cell containing the image. There are 
 * three values that can be passed to this method; 0 = To move and size the 
 * image with the cell, 2 = To move but don't size the image with the cell,
 * 3 = To prevent the image from moving or being resized along with the cell. If
 * an image is inserted using this class and placed into a single cell then if
 * the setAnchorType(int) method is called and a value of either 0 or 2 passed
 * to it, the resultant resizing behaviour may be a surprise. The image will not
 * grow in size of the column is made wider or the row higher but it will shrink
 * if the columns width or rows height are reduced.
