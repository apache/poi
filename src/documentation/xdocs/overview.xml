    <s1 title="What is it?">
      <p>The POI project is the master project for developing pure Java ports of those
        file formats based on Microsoft's OLE 2 Compound Document Format.  OLE 2 
        Compound Document Format is by Microsoft Office Documents, as well as 
        programs using MFC property sets to serialize their document objects.

      <s2 title="POI-Utils">
        <p>
          <link href="utils/index.html">POI-Utils</link> are general purpose artifacts
	  from POI development that have not yet been implemented elsewhere.  We're 
          always looking to donate these and maintain them as part of a general library
          used in another project.  These are things we need to complete our mission but
          are generally outside of it.
