      <section><title>POIFS for OLE 2 Documents</title>
        <p>
	  POIFS is the oldest and most stable part of the project.  It is our port of the OLE 2 Compound Document Format to
          pure Java.  It supports both read and write functionality.  All of our components ultimately rely on it by
          definition.  Please see <link href="./poifs/index.html">the POIFS project page</link> for more information.
	</p>
      </section>
      <section><title>HSSF and XSSF for Excel Documents</title>
        <p>
	  HSSF is our port of the Microsoft Excel 97(-2007) file format (BIFF8) to pure
          Java. XSSF is our port of the Microsoft Excel XML (2007+) file format (OOXML) to
          pure Java. SS is a package that provides common support for both formats with a common API.
	  They both support read and write capability. Please see
          <link href="./spreadsheet/index.html">the HSSF+XSSF project page</link> for more
          information.
	</p>
      </section>
      <section><title>HWPF and XWPF for Word Documents</title>
	<p>
	  HWPF is our port of the Microsoft Word 97 (-2003) file format to pure
	  Java.  It supports read, and limited write capabilities. Please see <link
	    href="./hwpf/index.html">the HWPF project page for more
	    information</link>.  This component remains in early stages of
	  development. It can already read and write simple files.
	</p>
	<p>
	  We are also working on the XWPF for the WordprocessingML (2007+) format from the 
	  OOXML specification.
	</p>
      </section>
      <section><title>HSLF and XSLF for PowerPoint Documents</title>
	<p>
	  HSLF is our port of the Microsoft PowerPoint 97(-2003) file format to pure
	  Java. It supports read and write capabilities. Please see <link
	    href="./slideshow/index.html">the HSLF project page for more
	    information</link>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  We are also working on the XSLF for the PresentationML (2007+) format from the 
	  OOXML specification.
	</p>
      </section>
      <section><title>HPSF for OLE 2 Document Properties</title>
	<p>
	  HPSF is our port of the OLE 2 property set format to pure
	  Java. Property sets are mostly use to store a document's properties
	  (title, author, date of last modification etc.), but they can be used
	  for application-specific purposes as well.
	</p>
	<p>
	  HPSF supports both reading and writing of properties.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Please see <link href="./hpsf/index.html">the HPSF project
	    page</link> for more information.
	</p>
      </section>
      <section><title>HDGF for Visio Documents</title>
	<p>
	  HDGF is our port of the Microsoft Viso 97(-2003) file format to pure
	  Java. It currently only supports reading at a very low level, and
	  simple text extraction. Please see <link
	    href="./hdgf/index.html">the HDGF project page for more
	    information</link>.
	</p>
      </section>
      <section><title>HPBF for Publisher Documents</title>
	<p>
	  HPBF is our port of the Microsoft Publisher 98(-2007) file format to pure
	  Java. It currently only supports reading at a low level for around
	  half of the file parts, and simple text extraction.  Please see <link
	    href="./hpbf/index.html">the HPBF project page for more
	    information</link>.
	</p>
      </section>
      <section><title>HSMF for Outlook Messages</title>
	<p>
	  HSMF is our port of the Microsoft Outlook message file format to pure
	  Java. It currently only some of the textual content of MSG files. 
	  Further support and documentation is expected over the comming weeks and months.
	  For now, users are advised to consult the unit tests for example use.
	  Please see <link href="./hsmf/index.html">the HPBF project page for more
	    information</link>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Microsoft has recently added the Outlook file format to its OSP. More information
	  is now available making implementation of this API an easier task.

    <section><title>What is it?</title>
      <p>The Apache POI project is the master project for developing pure
        Java ports of file formats based on Microsoft's OLE 2 Compound
        Document Format.  OLE 2 Compound Document Format is used by
        Microsoft Office Documents, as well as by programs using MFC
        property sets to serialize their document objects.
      </p>
      <p>Apache POI is also the master project for developing pure
        Java ports of file formats based on Office Open XML (ooxml.) 
	OOXML is part of an ECMA / ISO standardisation effort. This
	documentation is quite large, but you can normally find the bit you
	need without too much effort!
	<link href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-376.htm">ECMA-376 standard is here</link>,
	and is also under the <link href="http://www.microsoft.com/interop/osp">Microsoft OSP</link>.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="components"><title>Component Map</title>
      <p>
        The Apache POI distribution consists of support for many document file formats. This support is provided
	in several Jar files. Not all of the Jars are needed for every format. The following tables
        show the relationships between POI components, Maven repository tags, and the project's Jar files.
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Component</th>
          <th>Application type</th>

      <p>
	This table maps artifacts into the jar file name. "version-yyyymmdd" is the POI version stamp. For the latest release it is
	3.5-FINAL-20090928.
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Maven artifactId</th>

          <td>ooxml-schemas</td>
          <td>ooxml-schemas-1.0.jar</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
	OOXML file formats (poi-ooxml) also require ooxml-schemas-1.0.jar. This jar is large and we are experimenting with smaller versions.
	Details are available on the dev mailing list.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section><title>Examples</title>
      <p>
	Small sample programs using the POI API are available in the
        <em>src/examples</em> directory of the source distribution. Before
        studying the source code you might want to have a look at the
        "Examples" section of the <link href="apidocs/overview-summary.html">POI API
          documentation</link>.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section><title>Contributed Software</title>
      <p>
	Besides the "official" components outlined above there is some further
	software distributed with POI. This is called "contributed" software. It
        is not explicitly recommended or even maintained by the POI team, but
        it might still be useful to you.
      </p>
      <section><title>POI Browser</title>
        <p>
	  The POI Browser is a very simple Swing GUI tool that displays the
          internal structure of a Microsoft Office file and especially the
          property set streams. Further information and  instructions how to
          execute it can be found in the <link
	    href="apidocs/org/apache/poi/contrib/poibrowser/package-summary.html#package_description">POI
            Browser package description</link>.
