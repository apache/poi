  <section><title>The Licensing</title>
   <p>
     The POI project is <link href="http://www.opensource.org">OpenSource</link>
     and developed/distributed under the <link 
     href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/licence-FAQ.html">
     Apache Software License</link>.  Unlike other licenses this license allows
     free open source development; however, it does not require you to release
     your source or use any particular license for your source.  If you wish
     to contribute to POI (which you're very welcome and encouraged to do so)
     then you must agree to release the rights of your source to us under this
     license.

  <section><title>Publicly Available Information on the file formats</title>
  <p>
   In early 2008, Microsoft made a fairly complete set of documentation
   on the binary file formats freely and publicly available. These were 
   released under the <link href="http://www.microsoft.com/interop/osp">Open
   Specification Promise</link>, which does allow us to use them for
   building open source software under the <link 
     href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/licence-FAQ.html">
   Apache Software License</link>.
  </p>
  <p>
   You can download the documentation on Excel, Word, PowerPoint and
   Escher (drawing) from 
   <link href="http://www.microsoft.com/interop/docs/OfficeBinaryFormats.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/interop/docs/OfficeBinaryFormats.mspx</link>.
   Documentation on a few of the supporting technologies used in these
   file formats can be downloaded from
   <link href="http://www.microsoft.com/interop/docs/supportingtechnologies.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/interop/docs/supportingtechnologies.mspx</link>.
  </p>
  <p>
   Previously, Microsoft published a book on the Excel 97 file format.
   It can still be of plenty of use, and is handy dead tree form. Pick up
   a copy of "Excel 97 Developer's Kit" from your favourite second hand
   book store.
  </p>
  <p>
   The newer Office Open XML (ooxml) file formats are documented as part
   of the ECMA / ISO standardisation effort for the formats. This 
   documentation is quite large, but you can normally find the bit you
   need without too much effort! This can be downloaded from
   <link href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-376.htm">http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-376.htm</link>,
   and is also under the <link href="http://www.microsoft.com/interop/osp">OSP</link>.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is also worth checking the documentation and code of the other
   open source implementations of the file formats.
  </p>
  </section>
  <section><title>I just signed an NDA to get a spec from Microsoft and I'd like to contribute</title>
   <p>
     In short, stay away, stay far far away.  Implementing these file formats
     in POI is done strictly by using public information.  Public information
     includes sources from other open source projects, books that state the 
     purpose intended is for allowing implementation of the file format and 
     do not require any non-disclosure agreement and just hard work. 
     We are intent on keeping it
     legal, by contributing patches you agree to do the same.
   </p>
   <p> 
     If you've ever received information regarding the OLE 2 Compound Document
     Format under any type of exclusionary agreement from Microsoft, or  
     (possibly illegally) received such information from a person bound by
     such an agreement, you cannot participate in this project. (Sorry)
   </p>
   <p>
     Those submitting patches that show insight into the file format may be 
     asked to state explicitly that they have only ever read the publicly
     available file format information, and not any received under an NDA
     or similar.

  <section><title>I just want to get involved but don't know where to start</title>
   <ul>
     <li>Read the rest of the website, understand what POI is and what it does,
         the project vision, etc.</li>
     <li>Use POI a bit, look for gaps in the documentation and examples.</li>
     <li>Join the mail lists and share your knowledge with others.</li>
     <li>Get <link href="subversion.html">Subversion</link> and check out the POI source tree</li>
     <li>Documentation is always the best place to start contributing, maybe you found that if the documentation just told you how to do X then it would make more sense, modify the documentation.</li>
     <li>Get used to building POI, you'll be doing it a lot, be one with the build, know its targets, etc.</li>
     <li>Write Unit Tests.  Great way to understand POI.  Look for classes that aren't tested, or aren't tested on a public/protected method level, start there.</li>
     <li>Download the file format documentation from Microsoft -
      <link href="http://www.microsoft.com/interop/docs/OfficeBinaryFormats.mspx">OLE2 Binary File Formats</link> or
      <link href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-376.htm">OOXML XML File Formats</link></li>
     <li>Submit patches (see below) of your contributions, modifications.</li>
     <li>Fill out new features, see <link href="http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?product=POI">Bug database</link> for suggestions.</li>
   </ul>
  </section>
  <section><title>Submitting Patches</title>
   <p>
     Create patches by getting the latest sources from Subversion.
     Alter or add files as appropriate.  Then, from the poi directiory,
     type svn diff > mypatch.patch.  This will capture all of your changes
     in a patch file of the appropriate format. However, svn diff won't
     capture any new files you may have added. So, if you've added any 
     files, create an archive (tar.bz2 preferred as its the smallest) in a 
     path-preserving archive format, relative to your poi directory. 
     You'll attach both files in the next step.
   </p>
   <p> 
     Patches are submitted via the <link href="http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?product=POI">Bug Database</link>.  
     Create a new bug, set the subject to [PATCH] followed by a brief description.  Explain you patch and any special instructions and submit/save it.  
     Next, go back to the bug, and create attachements for the patch files you
     created.  Be sure to describe not only the files purpose, but its format. 
     (Is that ZIP or a tgz or a bz2 or what?).
   </p>
   <p>
     Make sure your patches include the @author tag on any files you've altered
     or created.  Make sure you've documented your changes and altered the 
     examples/etc to reflect them.  Any new additions should have unit tests.
     Lastly, ensure that you've provided approriate javadoc.  (see 
     <link href="http://poi.apache.org/resolutions/res001.html">Coding
     Standards</link>).  Patches that are of low quality may be rejected or 
     the contributer may be asked to bring them up to spec.
   </p>
   <p>If you use a unix shell, you may find the following following
    sequence of commands useful for building the files to attach.</p>
   <source>
# Run this in the root of the checkout, i.e. the directory holding
#  build.xml and poi.pom

# Build the directory to hold new files
mkdir /tmp/poi-patch/
mkdir /tmp/poi-patch/new-files/

# Get changes to existing files
svn diff > /tmp/poi-patch/diff.txt

# Capture any new files, as svn diff won't include them
# Preserve the path
svn status | grep "^\?" | \
    awk '{printf "cp --parents %s /tmp/poi-patch/new-files/\n", $2 }' | sh -s

# tar up the new files
cd /tmp/poi-patch/new-files/
tar jcvf ../new-files.tar.bz2
cd ..

# Upload these to bugzilla
echo "Please upload to bugzilla:"
echo "   /tmp/poi-patch/diff.txt"
echo "   /tmp/poi-patch/new-files.tar.bz2"
