 * POI does not yet support opening .xlsb files with XSSFWorkbook, but you can read files with XSSFBReader
 * in org.apache.poi.xssf.eventusermodel.
 * <p>
 * This feature was added in poi-3.16-beta3 and should be considered experimental.
 * Most classes have been marked @Internal and the API is subject to change.
