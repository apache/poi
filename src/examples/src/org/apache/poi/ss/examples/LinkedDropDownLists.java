/**
 * Demonstrates one technique that may be used to create linked or dependent
 * drop down lists. This refers to a situation in which the selection made
 * in one drop down list affects the options that are displayed in the second
 * or subsequent drop down list(s). In this example, the value the user selects
 * from the down list in cell A1 will affect the values displayed in the linked
 * drop down list in cell B1. For the sake of simplicity, the data for the drop
 * down lists is included on the same worksheet but this does not have to be the
 * case; the data could appear on a separate sheet. If this were done, then the
 * names for the regions would have to be different, they would have to include
 * the name of the sheet.
 * 
 * There are two keys to this technique. The first is the use of named area or 
 * regions of cells to hold the data for the drop down lists and the second is
 * making use of the INDIRECT() function to convert a name into the addresses
 * of the cells it refers to.
 * 
 * Note that whilst this class builds just two linked drop down lists, there is
 * nothing to prevent more being created. Quite simply, use the value selected
 * by the user in one drop down list to determine what is shown in another and the
 * value selected in that drop down list to determine what is shown in a third,
 * and so on. Also, note that the data for the drop down lists is contained on
 * contained on the same sheet as the validations themselves. This is done simply
 * for simplicity and there is nothing to prevent a separate sheet being created
 * and used to hold the data. If this is done then problems may be encountered
 * if the sheet is opened with OpenOffice Calc. To prevent these problems, it is
 * better to include the name of the sheet when calling the setRefersToFormula()
 * method.

     * Called to populate the named areas/regions. The contents of the cells on
     * row one will be used to populate the first drop down list. The contents of

     * In all cases, the approach is to create a row, create and populate cells
     * with data and then specify a name that identifies those cells. With the
     * exception of the first range, the names that are chosen for each range
     * of cells are quite important. In short, each of the options the user 
     * could select in the first drop down list is used as the name for another
     * range of cells. Thus, in this example, the user can select either 
     * 'Animal', 'Vegetable' or 'Mineral' in the first drop down and so the
