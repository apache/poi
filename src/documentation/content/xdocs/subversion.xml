      <p>
         Most users of the source code probably don't need to have day to 
         day access to the source code as it changes. Most users will want
         to make use of our <link href="download.html">source release</link>
         packages, which contain the complete source tree for each binary
         release, suitable for browsing or debugging. These source releases
         are available from our
         <link href="download.html">download page.</link>
      </p>
      <p>
         The Apache POI sourcecode is also available as source artifacts
         in the Maven Central repository, which may be helpful for those
         users who make use of POI and wish to inspect the source (eg when
         debugging in an IDE).

      </p>
      <p>Subversion is an open-source version control system. It has been contributed to the Apache Software Foundation and is
	now available <link href="http://subversion.apache.org/">here</link>.

       The root url of the ASF Subversion repository is 
       <link href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/">http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/</link>
       for non-committers and

      <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: When checking out a subproject using 
       subversion, ensure that you are checking out a tag, a branch or trunk 
       (the main-line) and not all tags and branches, to avoid filling up 
       your hard-disk and wasting bandwidth.

    <section><title>Git access to POI sources </title>
      <p>
        The master source repository for Apache POI is the Subversion
        one listed above. To support those users and developers who prefer
        to use the Git tooling, read-only access to the POI source tree is
        also available via Git. The Git mirrors normally track SVN to 
        within a few minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The official read-only Git repository for Apache POI is available
        from <link href="http://git.apache.org/">git.apache.org/</link> .
        The Git Clone URL is: <link href="git://git.apache.org/poi.git">git://git.apache.org/poi.git</link> 
        and Http Clone URL: <link href="http://git.apache.org/poi.git">http://git.apache.org/poi.git</link> .
         Please see the <link href="http://git.apache.org/">Git at 
         Apache</link> page for more details on the service.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the <link href="http://git.apache.org/">git.apache.org/</link>
        repository, changes are also mirrored in near-realtime to GitHub.
        The GitHub repository is available at
        <link href="https://github.com/apache/poi">https://github.com/apache/poi</link> .
        Please note that the GitHub repository is read-only, and all 
        contributions should continue to be sent via Bugzilla for tracking.
        (Git patches are fine though). Please see the
        <link href="guidelines.html">contribution guidelines</link> for more 
        information on getting involved in the project.</p>
