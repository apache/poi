    <section><title>What is it?</title>
      <p>The POI project is the master project for developing pure
        Java ports of file formats based on Microsoft's OLE 2 Compound
        Document Format.  OLE 2 Compound Document Format is used by
        Microsoft Office Documents, as well as by programs using MFC
        property sets to serialize their document objects.
      </p>

      <section><title>POI-Utils</title>
        <p>
          <link href="utils/index.html">POI-Utils</link> are general purpose artifacts
          from POI development that have not yet been implemented elsewhere.  We're
          always looking to donate these and maintain them as part of a general library
          used in another project.  These are things we need to complete our mission but
          are generally outside of it.

    <section>
      <title>Examples</title>

      <p>Small sample programs using the POI API are available in the
        <em>src/examples</em> directory of the source distribution. Before
        studying the source code you might want to have a look at the
        "Examples" section of the <link
          href="apidocs/overview-summary.html">POI API
          documentation</link>.</p>
    </section>

    <section><title>Contributed Software</title>
      <p>Besides the "official" components outlined above there is some further
      software distributed with POI. This is called "contributed" software. It
        is not explicitly recommended or even maintained by the POI team, but
        it might still be useful to you.</p>

      <section>
        <title>POI Browser</title>
        <p>The POI Browser is a very simple Swing GUI tool that displays the
          internal structure of a Microsoft Office file and especially the
          property set streams. Further information and  instructions how to
          execute it can be found in the <link
            href="apidocs/org/apache/poi/contrib/poibrowser/package-summary.html#package_description">POI
            Browser package description</link>.</p>
