            <p>
              Don't forget which branch you are currently on.  This is critically
              important.  Committing stuff to the wrong branch causes all sorts of
              headaches.  Best to name your checkout after the branch you are on.
            </p>

        <section><title>Who Manages Branching?</title>
            <p>
                All branching is currently managed by Glen Stampoultzis.  If you wish
                to create your own branch please let him know.  Merging is also
                handled by Glen.  Just pop him a mail if you feel it's necessary to
                create a branch or perform a merge.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason to go through a single point for branching is that it can be
                an easy thing to get wrong.  Having a single person managing branches
                means there is less chance of getting getting our wires crossed with this
                difficult area of CVS.
