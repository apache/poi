         <title>Overview</title>

         <p>HMEF is the POI Project's pure Java implementation of Microsoft's
            TNEF (Transport Neurtral Encoding Format), aka winmail.dat,
            which is used by Outlook and Exchange in some situations.</p>
          <p>Currently, HMEF provides a read-only api for accessing common
            message and attachment attributes, including the message body
            and attachment files. In addition, it's possible to have 
            read-only access to all of the underlying TNEF and MAPI 
            attributes of the message and attachments.</p>
          <p>HMEF also provides a command line tool for extracting out
            the message body and attachment files from a TNEF (winmail.dat)
            file.</p>

        <note> 
          This code currently lives the 
          <link href="http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/poi/trunk/src/scratchpad/">scratchpad area</link> 
          of the POI SVN repository. 
          Ensure that you have the scratchpad jar or the scratchpad 
          build area in your classpath before experimenting with this code.
        </note>
        <note> 
          This code is a new POI feature, and the first release that will
          contain it will be POI 3.8 beta 2. Until then, you will need to
          build your own jars from a <link href="../subversion.html">svn
          checkout</link>.

         <title>Using HMEF to access TNEF (winmail.dat) files</title>

         <section>
           <title>Easy extraction of message body and attachment files</title>
  
           <p>The class <em>org.apache.poi.hmef.extractor.HMEFContentsExtractor</em>
             provides both command line and Java extraction. It allows the
             saving of the message body (an RTF file), and all of the 
             attachment files, to a single directory as specified.</p>

           <p>From the command line, simply call the class specifying the
             TNEF file to extract, and the directory to place the extracted
             files into, eg:</p>
           <source>
              java -classpath poi-3.8-FINAL.jar:poi-scratchpad-3.8-FINAL.jar org.apache.poi.hmef.extractor.HMEFContentsExtractor winmail.dat /tmp/extracted/
           </source>

           <p>From Java, there are two method calls on the class, one to
             extract the message body RTF to a file, and the other to extract
             all the attachments to a directory. A typical use would be:</p>
           <source>
public void extract(String winmailFilename, String directoryName) throws Exception {
   HMEFContentsExtractor ext = new HMEFContentsExtractor(new File(winmailFilename));
      
   File dir = new File(directoryName);
   File rtf = new File(dir, "message.rtf");
   if(! dir.exists()) {
       throw new FileNotFoundException("Output directory " + dir.getName() + " not found");
   }
      
   System.out.println("Extracting...");
   ext.extractMessageBody(rtf);
   ext.extractAttachments(dir);
   System.out.println("Extraction completed");
}
           </source>
         </section>
  
         <section>
           <title>Attachment attributes and contents</title>
  
           <p>To get at your attachments, simply call the
             <em>getAttachments()</em> method on a <em>HMEFMessage</em>
             instance, and you'll receive a list of all the attachments.</p>
           <p>When you have a <em>org.apache.poi.hmef.Attachment</em> object, 
             there are several helper methods available. These will all
             return the value of the appropriate underlying attachment
             attributes, or null if for some reason the attribute isn't
             present in your file.</p>
           <ul>
            <li><em>getFilename()</em> - returns the name of the attachment
              file, possibly in 8.3 format</li>
            <li><em>getLongFilename()</em> - returns the full name of the 
              attachment file</li>
            <li><em>getExtension()</em> - returns the extension of the
              attachment file, including the "."</li>
            <li><em>getModifiedDate()</em> - returns the date that the 
              attachment file was last edited on</li>
            <li><em>getContents()</em> - returns a byte array of the contents
              of the attached file</li>
            <li><em>getRenderedMetaFile()</em> - returns a byte array of 
              a windows meta file representation of the attached file</li>
           </ul>
         </section>
  
         <section>
           <title>Message attributes and message body</title>
  
           <p>A <em>org.apache.poi.hmef.HMEFMessage</em> instance is created
             from an <em>InputStream</em> of the underlying TNEF (winmail.dat)
             file.</p>
           <p>From a <em>HMEFMessage</em>, there are three main methods of
            interest to call:</p>
           <ul>
             <li><em>getBody()</em> - returns a String containing the RTF
               contents of the message body. 
               <em>Note - see limitations</em></li>
             <li><em>getSubject()</em> - returns the message subject</li>
             <li><em>getAttachments()</em> - returns the list of 
               <em>Attachment</em> objects for the message</li>
           </ul>
         </section>
  
         <section>
           <title>Low level attribute access</title>
  
           <p>Both Messages and Attachments contain two kinds of attributes.
             These are <em>TNEFAttribute</em> and <em>MAPIAttribute</em>.</p>
           <p>TNEFAttribute is specific to TNEF files in terms of the 
             available types and properties. In general, Attachments have a
             few more useful ones of these then Messages.</p>
           <p>MAPIAttributes hold standard MAPI properties and values, and
             work in a similar way to <link href="../hsmf/">HSMF 
             (Outlook)</link> does. There are typically many of these on both
             Messages and Attachments. <em>Note - see limitations</em></p>
           <p>Both <em>HMEFMessage</em> and <em>Attachment</em> supports
             support two different ways of getting to attributes of interest.
             Firstly, they support list getters, to return all attributes
             (either TNEF or MAPI). Secondly, they support specific getters by
             TNEF or MAPI property.</p>
           <source>
HMEFMessage msg = new HMEFMessage(new FileInputStream(file));
for(TNEFAttribute attr : msg.getMessageAttributes) {
   System.out.println("TNEF : " + attr);
}
for(MAPIAttribute attr : msg.getMessageMAPIAttributes) {
   System.out.println("MAPI : " + attr);
}
System.out.println("Subject is " + msg.getMessageMAPIAttribute(MAPIProperty.CONVERSATION_TOPIC));

for(Attachment attach : msg.getAttachments()) {
   for(TNEFAttribute attr : attach.getAttributes) {
      System.out.println("A.TNEF : " + attr);
   }
   for(MAPIAttribute attr : attach.getMAPIAttributes) {
      System.out.println("A.MAPI : " + attr);
   }
   System.out.println("Filename is " + attach.getAttribute(TNEFProperty.CID_ATTACHTITLE));
   System.out.println("Extension is " + attach.getMAPIAttribute(MAPIProperty.ATTACH_EXTENSION));
}
           </source>
         </section>
       </section>

       <section>
         <title>Investigating a TNEF file</title>

			<p>To get a feel for the contents of a file, and to track down
			 where data of interest is stored, HMEF comes with
			 <link href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/poi/trunk/src/scratchpad/src/org/apache/poi/hmef/dev/">HMEFDumper</link>
			 to print out the contents of the file.</p>

       <section>
         <title>Limitations</title>

          <p>HMEF is currently a work-in-progress, and not everything
            works yet. The current limitations are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Compressed RTF Message Bodies are not correctly 
              decompressed. This means that a call to 
              <em>HMEFMessage.getBody()</em> is unlikely to return the
              correct RTF.</li>
            <li>Non-standard MAPI properties from the range 0x8000 to 0x8fff
              may not be being quite correctly turned into attributes. 
              The values show up, but the name and type may not always
              be correct.</li>
            <li>All testing so far has been performed on a small number of
              English documents. We think we're correctly turning bytes into
              Java unicode strings, but we need a few non-English sample
              files in the test suite to verify this!</li>
          </ul>
