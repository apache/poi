 <section><title>About Resolutions</title>
        <p>
                Every project in Apache has resolutions that they vote on.
                Decisions are made, etc.  But what happens once those decisions
                are made?  They are archived in the mail list archive never to
                be read again (once its not in the top 10 or so posts).  So they
                get discussed again and again.
        </p>
        <p>
                Rather than have that big waste of time, we have this section to
                record important POI decisions.  Once a decision is passed it 
                need only be linked to this page (either by creating a page for 
                it or by simply linking it to the archive messages).  Wherever 
                possible a brief about how many votes for and against an maybe
                some background should be posted.
        </p>
        <p>
                This section is intended mainly to reduce big waste of time
                discussions from taking away from whats important...developing
                POI! :-D
