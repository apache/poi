            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>
                This is an
                <strong>informal</strong> list - in chronological order -
                of some of the noteworthy patches that have been posted
                to the
                <code>developers</code> mailing list.
                These patches are not (yet) part of the POI project, but need reviewing for possible
                inclusion. This system was instituted because, due to the large volume of mail and
                the lack of time of the committers, some patches tended to get forgotten about. This
                queue does not guarantee that any patch will be reviewed within a reasonable time frame,
                but it does at least make them easier to find!
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Reviewers wanted!</strong> - If you have time to review and/or test these patches,
                we would be grateful for your time. Please post comments to the dev mailing lists.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before submitting a patch, please read the page on
                <link href="contrib.xml">Third-Party
                    Contributions</link>. The preferred submission method for patches is:
            </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Post to POI developers list</li>
        <li>Describe the patch, the reason for it and (if necessary) why this
          is important.</li>
        <li>Generate the patch in the unified diff format. This format is
          created by the typical Subversion client when you execute the
          <code>svn diff</code> command or the equivalent of it in a GUI environment.</li>
        <li>Also generate a documentation patch or new file, if this is
          something that should be documented.</li>
        <li>Post as an attachment rather than inline (unless it is trivially small).</li>
      </ul>
            <p>Following the above guidelines will facilitate your patch being reviewed
                and applied efficiently.</p>
