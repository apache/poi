            <title>Install Apache Ant</title>
            <p>
                The POI build system requires <link href="http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi">Apache Ant</link>
            </p>
            <p>
                Specifically the build has been tested to work with Ant version
                1.7.1.  To install the product download the distribution and follow the instructions.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	        Remember to set the ANT_HOME environment variable and add ANT_HOME/bin

            <p>
                Running unit tests and building a distribution requires <link href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit</link>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just pick the latest versions of the jars from 
		<link href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/junit/files/junit/">SourceForge</link> and place
                them in ANT_HOME/lib. Make sure that optional.jar is in ANT_HOME/lib.

            </p>
            <p>
                Specifically the build has been tested to work with Forrest 0.5. This is an old release which is available
		<link href="http://archive.apache.org/dist/forrest/pre-0.6/">here</link>.
