/**
 * Demonstrates how to add an image to a worksheet and set that images size
 * to a specific number of millimetres irrespective of the width of the columns
 * or height of the rows. Overridden methods are provided so that the location
 * of the image - the cells row and column coordinates that define the top
 * left hand corners of the image - can be identified either in the familiar
 * Excel manner - A1 for instance - or using POI's methodology of a column and
 * row index where 0, 0 would indicate cell A1.
 *
 * The best way to make use of these techniques is to delay adding the image to
 * the sheet until all other work has been completed. That way, the sizes of
 * all rows and columns will have been adjusted - assuming that step was
 * necessary. Even though the anchors type is set to prevent the image moving
 * or re-sizing, this setting does not have any effect until the sheet is being
 * viewed using the Excel application.
 *
 * The key to the process is the ClientAnchor class. It defines methods that allow
 * us to define the location of an image by specifying the following;
 *
 *      * How far - in terms of coordinate positions - the image should be inset
 *      from the left hand border of a cell.
 *      * How far - in terms of coordinate positions - the image should be inset
 *      from the from the top of the cell.
 *      * How far - in terms of coordinate positions - the right hand edge of
 *      the image should protrude into a cell (measured from the cells left hand
 *      edge to the images right hand edge).
 *      * How far - in terms of coordinate positions - the bottom edge of the
 *      image should protrude into a row (measured from the cells top edge to
 *      the images bottom edge).
 *      * The index of the column that contains the cell whose top left hand
 *      corner should be aligned with the top left hand corner of the image.
 *      * The index of the row that contains the cell whose top left hand corner
 *      should be aligned with the images top left hand corner.
 *      * The index of the column that contains the cell whose top left hand
 *      corner should be aligned with the images bottom right hand corner
 *      * The index number of the row that contains the cell whose top left
 *      hand corner should be aligned with the images bottom right hand corner.
 *
 * It can be used to add an image into cell A1, for example, in the following
 * manner;
 *
 *      ClientAnchor anchor = sheet.getWorkbook().getCreationHelper().createClientAnchor();
 *
 *      anchor.setDx1(0);
 *      anchor.setDy1(0);
 *      anchor.setDx2(0);
 *      anchor.setDy2(0);
 *      anchor.setCol1(0);
 *      anchor.setRow1(0);
 *      anchor.setCol2(1);
 *      anchor.setRow2(1);
 *
 * Taken together, the first four methods define the locations of the top left
 * and bottom right hand corners of the image if you imagine that the image is
 * represented by a simple rectangle. The setDx1() and setDy1() methods locate
 * the top left hand corner of the image while setDx2() and and Dy2() locate the
 * bottom right hand corner of the image. An individual image can be inserted
 * into a single cell or is can lie across many cells and the latter four methods
 * are used to define just where the image should be positioned. They do this by
 * again by identifying where the top left and bottom right hand corners of the
 * image should be located but this time in terms of the indexes of the cells
 * in which those corners should be located. The setCol1() and setRow1() methods
 * together identify the cell that should contain the top left hand corner of
 * the image while setCol2() and setRow2() do the same for the images bottom
 * right hand corner. 
 *
 * Knowing that, it is possible to look again at the example above and to see
 * that the top left hand corner of the image will be located in cell A1 (0, 0)
 * and it will be aligned with the very top left hand corner of the cell. Likewise,
 * the bottom right hand corner of the image will be located in cell B2 (1, 1) and
 * it will again be aligned with the top left hand corner of the cell. This has the
 * effect of making the image seem to occupy the whole of cell A1. Interestingly, it
 * also has an effect on the images resizing behaviour because testing has 
 * demonstrated that if the image is wholly contained within one cell and is not
 * 'attached' for want of a better word, to a neighbouring cell, then that image
 * will not increase in size in response to the user dragging the column wider
 * or the cell higher.
 *
 * The following example demonstrates a slightly different way to insert an
 * image into cell A1 and to ensure that it occupies the whole of the cell. This
 * is accomplished by specifying the the images bottom right hand corner should be
 * aligned with the bottom right hand corner of the cell. It is also a case
 * where the image will not increase in size if the user increases the size of
 * the enclosing cell - irrespective of the anchors type - but it will reduce in
 * size if the cell is made smaller.
 *
 *      ClientAnchor anchor = sheet.getWorkbook().getCreationHelper().createClientAnchor();
 *
 *      anchor.setDx1(0);
 *      anchor.setDy1(0);
 *      anchor.setDx2(1023);
 *      anchor.setDy2(255);
 *      anchor.setCol1(0);
 *      anchor.setRow1(0);
 *      anchor.setCol2(0);
 *      anchor.setRow2(0);
 *
 * Note that the final four method calls all pass the same value and seem to
 * indicate that the images top left hand corner is aligned with the top left
 * hand corner of cell A1 and that it's bottom right hand corner is also
 * aligned with the top left hand corner of cell A1. Yet, running this code
 * would see the image fully occupying cell A1. That is the result of the
 * values passed to parameters three and four; these I have referred to as
 * determining the images coordinates within the cell. They indicate that the
 * image should occupy - in order - the full width of the column and the full
 * height of the row.
 *
 * The co-ordinate values shown are the maxima; and they are independent of
 * row height/column width and of the font used. Passing 255 will always result
 * in the image occupying the full height of the row and passing 1023 will
 * always result in the image occupying the full width of the column. They help
 * in situations where an image is larger than a column/row and must overlap
 * into the next column/row. Using them does mean, however, that it is often
 * necessary to perform conversions between Excels characters units, points,
 * pixels and millimetres in order to establish how many rows/columns an image
 * should occupy and just what the various insets ought to be.
 *
 * Note that the setDx1(int) and setDy1(int) methods of the ClientAchor class
 * are not made use of in the code that follows. It would be fairly trivial
 * however to extend this example further and provide methods that would centre
 * an image within a cell or allow the user to specify that a plain border a
 * fixed number of millimetres wide should wrap around the image. Those first
 * two parameters would make this sort of functionality perfectly possible.
 *
 * Owing to the various conversions used, the actual size of the image may vary
 * from that required; testing has so far found this to be in the region of
 * plus or minus two millimetres. Most likely by modifying the way the
 * calculations are performed - possibly using double(s) throughout and
 * rounding the values at the correct point - it is likely that these errors
 * could be reduced or removed.
 *
 * A note concerning Excels image resizing behaviour. The ClientAnchor
 * class contains a method called setAnchorType(int) which can be used to
 * determine how Excel will resize an image in response to the user increasing
 * or decreasing the dimensions of the cell containing the image. There are 
 * three values that can be passed to this method; 0 = To move and size the 
 * image with the cell, 2 = To move but don't size the image with the cell,
 * 3 = To prevent the image from moving or being resized along with the cell. If
 * an image is inserted using this class and placed into a single cell then if
 * the setAnchorType(int) method is called and a value of either 0 or 2 passed
 * to it, the resultant resizing behaviour may be a surprise. The image will not
 * grow in size of the column is made wider or the row higher but it will shrink
 * if the columns width or rows height are reduced.

 * @version 1.00 5th August 2009.
 *          2.00 26th February 2010.
 *               Ported to make use of the the SS usermodel classes.
 *               Ability to reuse the Drawing Patriarch so that multiple images
 *               can be inserted without unintentionally erasing earlier images.
 *               Check on image type added; i.e. jpg, jpeg or png.
 *               The String used to contain the files name is now converted
 *               into a URL.
 *          2.10 17th May 2012
 *               Corrected gross error that occurred when using the code with
 *               XSSF or SXSSF workbooks. In short, the code did not correctly
 *               calculate the size of the image(s) owing to the use of EMUs
 *               within the OOXML file format. That problem has largely been
 *               corrected although it should be mentioned that images are not
 *               sized with the same level of accuracy. Discrepancies of up to
 *               2mm have been noted in testing. Further investigation will
 *               continue to rectify this issue.
