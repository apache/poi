            <title>POI-HSLF</title>

            <p>HSLF is the POI Project's pure Java implementation of the Powerpoint '97(-2007) file format. </p>
    <p>HSLF provides a way to read, create or modify PowerPoint  presentations. In particular, it provides:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>api for data extraction (text, pictures, embedded objects, sounds)</li>
                <li>usermodel api for creating, reading and modifying ppt files</li>
            </ul>
            <note> 
                This code currently lives the 
                <link href="http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/poi/trunk/src/scratchpad/">scratchpad area</link> 
                of the POI SVN repository. 
				Ensure that you have the scratchpad jar or the scratchpad 
                build area in your classpath before experimenting with 
                this code - the main POI jar is not enough.

            information on using this API. Comments and fixes gratefully accepted on the POI
            dev mailing lists.</p>

            <title>POI-XSLF</title>
            <p>
            XSLF is the POI Project's pure Java implementation of the PowerPoint 2007 OOXML (.xlsx) file format. 
            Whilst HSLF and XSLF provide similar features, there is not a common interface across the two of them at this time.
            </p>
            <p>
            Please note that XSLF is still in early development and is a subject to incompatible changes in future. 
            </p>
            <p>
              A quick guide is available in 
                <link href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/poi/trunk/src/examples/src/org/apache/poi/xslf/usermodel/">XSLF Examples</link>
