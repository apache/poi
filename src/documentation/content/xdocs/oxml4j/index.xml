          <title>Overview</title>
          <p>OpenXML4J is the POI Project's pure Java implementation of the Open Packaging Conventions (OPC) defined in 
            <link href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-376.htm">ECMA-376</link>.</p>
          <p>Every OpenXML file comprises a collection of byte streams called parts, combined into a container called a package. 
            POI OpenXML4J provides a physical implementation of the OPC that uses the Zip file format.</p>
