       <p>
          A number of people are using POI for a variety of purposes.  As with
          any new API or technology, the first question people generally ask
          is not "how can I" but rather "Who else is doing what I'm about to 
          do?"  This is understandable with the abismal success rate in the 
          software business.  These case statements are meant to help create
          confidence and understanding.

    <section><title>Submitting a Case Study</title>
       <p>
          We are actively seeking case studies for this page (after all it 
          just started).  Andy Oliver (acoliver at apache dot org) has 
          agreed to have a few T-Shirts printed with the POI logo (once its
          chosen) for the first
          few best submissions.  To submit a case study, either  
          <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/poi/getinvolved/index.html">
          submit a patch for this page</link> (preferred) or email it to the 
          <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/mail.html">mailing list
          </link>.

      <p>
      Edwards and Kelcey Technology (http://www.ekcorp.com/) developed a 
      Facility
      Managament and Maintenance System for the Telecommunications industry 
      based
      on Turbine and Velocity. Originally the invoicing was done with a simple 
      CVS
      sheet which was then marked up by accounts and customized for each client.
      As growth has been consistent with the application, the requirement for
      invoices that need not be touched by hand increased. POI provided the
      solution to this issue, integrating easily and transparently into the
      system. POI HSSF was used to create the invoices directly from the server
      in
      Excel 97 format and now services over 150 unique invoices per month.
