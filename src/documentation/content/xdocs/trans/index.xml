      <p>
        The POI project has always had a very international following.  In fact even today POI is 
        more popular in Europe than in the US where the original founders reside.  Today POI is 
        developed by people from all over the world including India, Austrailia, Japan, and Russia. 
        We recognize and welcome our geographically and culturally diverse users and contributors and
        wish to accomidate you as best as we can.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Documentation has always been a cornerstone to POI's success.  No matter how fluent one is in 
        a second language, it is always easier to comprehend concepts explained in one's native language,
        therefore, we encourage volunteers to come and help us translate the documentation into other 
        languages.  Below is a list of the translations that are currently in progress and their status.
